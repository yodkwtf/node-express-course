## Send Email

A small app created to learn how to send emails using nodejs.

#### Goals

- Sending emails with nodejs

## Preview

The app was too small so I chose not deploy it anywhere. The only way to preview it is by running it locally.

#### Setup

Clone this repo first if you haven't

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yodkwtf/nodejs-course.git
```

Navigate to project directory, install dependencies and run

```bash
npm install && npm start
```
