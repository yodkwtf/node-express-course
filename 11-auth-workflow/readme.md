## Q/As

- What's the difference b/w accessToken and refreshToken?

- How the `verify-email` route works?

- How `forgot-email` route works?

- What's the point of `verificationToken` for verify-email?

- What's the point of `passwordToken` and `passwordTokenExpirationDate` in forgot-password?

- At some places we arent checking if email doesnt exist in database (for eg, reset-password, forgot-password). We simply say check your email for reset link. Why is that?
